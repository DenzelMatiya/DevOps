## Introduction
In this Lab, you will design, implement, deploy and monitor a simple conference registration platform using one of Python, Ruby or PHP programming languages. More specifically, you will be required to:
1. Create 2-3 page design and/or architecture document to support high availability of the platform
2. Implement the platform. You are highly recommended not to use programming language frameworks for this Lab.
3. Deploy the platform. You will deploy the containerized setup of the platform on the infrastructure availed [Please share a copy of your SSH public key to **alex.mwotil[at]ubuntunet[dot]net** ]
4. Build the CI/CD for the platform. You can use any of the CI/CD tools to ensure that platform changes are pushed all through to the running instance.
5. Perform monitoring of the platform with all the associated services to ensure its optimal operation

## Required
1. The design document.
2. Source code.
3. Description of the CI/CD pipeline.
4. Access to the platform and monitoring tools used.

All the artefacts above should be available on a public Github repository that you will share a link to for assessment.
